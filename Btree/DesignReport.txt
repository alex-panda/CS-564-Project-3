4. Design report: 15%. Your design report must describe the following design choices that you make:
    • Any implementation choices that you make. How often do you keep pages
        pinned? How efficient is your implementation? We are not going to run a
        speed test, but will look at the code to check if you are performing operations
        that are inefficient, such as unnecessarily traversing the tree up and down mul-
        tiple times during range searches
    • Please use your report to justify any additional design choices that you make.
